<seg>I don't like early morning meetings.</seg>
<seg>I don't like the way you talk to me.</seg>
<seg>I don't remember mailing the letter.</seg>
<seg>I don't understand its significance.</seg>
<seg>I don't want to be friends with you.</seg>
<seg>I don't want to hear about it again.</seg>
<seg>I don't wash my hair in the morning.</seg>
<seg>I feel like everybody's watching me.</seg>
<seg>I found this at the risk of my life.</seg>
<seg>I gather that they'll agree with us.</seg>
<seg>I get along with my younger brother.</seg>
<seg>I get two hour's exercise every day.</seg>

<seg>I had no trouble finding his office.</seg>
<seg>I have a large collection of stamps.</seg>
<seg>I have been in Japan for two months.</seg>
<seg>I have decided to carry on the work.</seg>
<seg>I have just been to the post office.</seg>
<seg>I have nothing to do with the crime.</seg>
<seg>I have the same trouble as you have.</seg>
<seg>I haven't seen her since last month.</seg>
<seg>I heard the children's happy voices.</seg>
<seg>I know you don't want to talk to me.</seg>
<seg>I let my sister use my new computer.</seg>
<seg>I like to go fishing with my father.</seg>
<seg>I looked for him in the supermarket.</seg>
<seg>I looked, but I didn't see anything. 我看過了,</seg>
<seg>I lost my key somewhere around here.</seg>
<seg>I made efforts to improve my grades.</seg>
<seg>I made several mistakes in the exam.</seg>
<seg>I made sure no one was following me.</seg>
<seg>I managed to make him understand it.</seg>
<seg>I noticed she was wearing a new hat.</seg>
<seg>I really liked the gift you gave me.</seg>
<seg>I refuse to be treated like a child.</seg>
<seg>I saw an old woman cross the street.</seg>
<seg>I should tell Tom what I have to do.</seg>
<seg>I spent last Sunday reading a novel.</seg>
<seg>I think I know who stole your watch.</seg>
<seg>I think I've found something better.</seg>
<seg>I think that fact is very important.</seg>
<seg>I thought Tom would enjoy the party.</seg>
<seg>I thought that you wanted to see me.</seg>
<seg>I thought you had to get up by 7:30.</seg>
<seg>I tried to stop that from happening.</seg>
<seg>I want it to be different this time.</seg>
<seg>I want my dinner brought to my room.</seg>
<seg>I was puzzled about what to do next.</seg>
<seg>I was still an amateur at that time.</seg>
<seg>I was surprised by his perseverance.</seg>
<seg>I was writing a letter when he came. 當他進來的時候,</seg>
<seg>I wash my hands before eating lunch.</seg>
<seg>I will never force you to marry him.</seg>
<seg>I work every day except for Sundays.</seg>
<seg>I work every day except for Sundays.</seg>

<seg>I'm getting more and more gray hair.</seg>
<seg>I'm getting off at the next station.</seg>
<seg>I'm getting off at the next station.</seg>
<seg>I'm going to see Tom in the morning.</seg>
<seg>I'm not as stupid as you think I am.</seg>
<seg>I'm not asking you. I'm begging you.</seg>
<seg>I'm not going to do anything to you.</seg>
<seg>I'm sorry that you are leaving here.</seg>
<seg>I'm sorry, could you say that again?</seg>
<seg>I'm sure you'll be back before long.</seg>
<seg>I'm trying to save room for dessert.</seg>
<seg>I've been feeling a little restless.</seg>
<seg>I've been here for a very long time.</seg>
<seg>I've decided to go a little further.</seg>
<seg>I've had a lot of work to do lately.</seg>
<seg>I've had to do everything by myself.</seg>
<seg>I've just finished eating breakfast.</seg>
<seg>I've never been to my uncle's house.</seg>
<seg>I've promised Tom that I'd be there.</seg>
<seg>I've studied English for five years.</seg>
<seg>If I were healthy, I would be happy.</seg>
<seg>If Tom doesn't surrender, shoot him.</seg>
<seg>If Tom is really alive, where is he?</seg>
<seg>If you can sing, that's good enough.</seg>
<seg>In the morning, I write in the park.</seg>
<seg>Is eating with chopsticks difficult?</seg>
<seg>Is it true you're trying to do that?</seg>
<seg>Is this the key you are looking for?</seg>
<seg>It became quiet again in the forest.</seg>
<seg>It is difficult to satisfy everyone.</seg>
<seg>It is necessary for you to go there.</seg>
<seg>It is no use crying over spilt milk.</seg>
<seg>It is strange that he should say so.</seg>
<seg>It looks like it'll rain today, too.</seg>
<seg>It was impossible to find an answer.</seg>
<seg>It would be great if you could sing.</seg>
<seg>It's bad manners to point at people.</seg>
<seg>It's my turn to choose where we eat.</seg>
<seg>It's no good trying to persuade her.</seg>
<seg>It's not something I'm very good at.</seg>
<seg>It's okay to take it easy sometimes.</seg>
<seg>It's too bad that you couldn't come.</seg>
<seg>Japan is an extremely noisy country.</seg>

<seg>My sister is taller than my brother.</seg>
<seg>My sleep was disturbed by the sound.</seg>
<seg>My uncle had me act as a translator.</seg>
<seg>No one can keep me from going there.</seg>
<seg>No one thinks Tom will win the race.</seg>
<seg>Not being tall isn't a disadvantage.</seg>
<seg>Not everyone who lives here is rich.</seg>
<seg>Old people often talk to themselves.</seg>
<seg>Open your mouth and close your eyes.</seg>
<seg>Opinions vary from person to person.</seg>

<seg>The volcano has become active again.</seg>
<seg>The waves crashed against the rocks.</seg>
<seg>The x-ray showed two broken fingers.</seg>

<seg>He's already too far away to hear us.</seg>
<seg>Here is the book you are looking for.</seg>
<seg>His office is near the train station.</seg>
<seg>His way of thinking is very childish.</seg>
<seg>How can you afford a place like this?</seg>
<seg>How long do you plan on staying here?</seg>
<seg>How many books do you read per month?</seg>
<seg>How much does a kilo of bananas cost?</seg>

<seg>I suggest that you don't trust Tom too much.</seg>
<seg>I think you're a lot stronger than you know.</seg>
<seg>I think you've mistaken me for someone else.</seg>
<seg>I thought Tom would want to know about that.</seg>
